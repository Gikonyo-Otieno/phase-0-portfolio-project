          <h1>The Road So Far</h1>
             <h3>Computer Programming</h3>
                <p>I'm currently at Moringa School pursuing a career in tech. So far I'm conversant with these languages</p>

                <img src="./images/filetype-java.svg" alt="JAVA">
                <p>Eventually I plan on moving into other technologies like android, because why not. I aim to use the knowledge I get aas well as my numerous passions like business and music to carve out a niche for myself in this ever changing world.</p>

              <h3>Restaurant Plartform for home kitchens</h3>
                <p>We all felt the pinch of the pandemic. Some had it worse than others. Many resorted to side-hustles and thus the home restaurants proliferated. However some have issues finding clients. That's where my idea comes in. The app I envision would connect home kitchens to their customers. It would handle orders, deliveries and the actual payment transaction.</p>

               <h3>Online car Dealerships with auction services</h3>
                <p>Marketplace for buyers and sellers around can meet and interact. Service for bith locally available vehicles as well as imported. Also incorporating auction services where anyone can bid for any car at anytime; hopefully resulting in getting a good price for the car of your choice.</p>

                <h3>Video and Music Streaming </h3>
                <p>Music and video streaming and eventually hosting of the data inhouse. My aim is to capitalize on the gap in the music market locally with regard to digital content creation. The plartform would open doors for creatives to express themselves fully.</p>

              <h3>Kids Learning Service</h3>
                <p>getting inspiration from sites I used as a child for example Microsoft Encarta, I'd like to create a site filled with immersive and relevant educational content for children. I learnt a lot from the sites I used and with life only becoming more tech based, I think it would be a good idea for children to start being conversant with computers in general early.</p>
